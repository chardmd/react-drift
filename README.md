React component implementation of Drift Chatbot Widget

![Alt Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chardmd/react-drift/master/screenshot.png)

### Install

```
npm install react-driftjs
```

### Usage

```javascript
import Drift from "react-driftjs";

<Drift appId="xxxxx" />; //get the appId from drift.com
```

### Identify User / Assign Attributes

To identify the user with an ID that is unique in your application, include a userId property with that value. This will trigger the chatbot to use the `identify` method method. If the userId is omitted, the component will have the chatbot use the `setUserAttributes` method.

```javascript
<Drift
  appId="xxxxx"
  userId="1234"
  attributes={{ email: "user@example.com", company: "Acme Inc" }}
/>
```

### Add Event Handlers

The chatbot widget emits several events. A listing of the events can be found here: https://devdocs.drift.com/docs/drift-events#section-first-interaction
To handle the events, assign an array of objects to the eventHandlers property. The `event` property will match the name of the event emitted by drift. The `function` property is the function definition of the handler.

```javascript
<Drift
  appId="xxxxx"
  eventHandlers={[
    { event: "conversation:firstInteraction", function: handleInteraction },
  ]}
/>;

var handleInteraction = function () {
  console.log("User has just interacted with the chatbot");
};
```

### Add Custom Styles

To add custom styling to the root `<iframe>` element (e.g. to change the position of the chatbot widget) you can assign a style object to the `style` property. This object will be parsed as a css string and added to a style tag in the head of the document.

```javascript
<Drift
  appId="xxxxx"
  style={{
    bottom: "100px",
  }}
/>
```
